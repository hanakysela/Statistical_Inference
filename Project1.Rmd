# Project 1 - Simulation excercise

## Overview
In this project I will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem.

I am going to 
Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
Show that the distribution is approximately normal.

## Simulation


```{r}

set.seed(123456) #allows reproducibility

# packages management
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
  pacman::p_load(ggplot2, knitr)

```
